                <h3>9 Things You Need to Be Okay With to Love Living in NYC
                    in LIVING, NYC LIFE by Tracy Kaler</h3>
                <p>Loving the idea of living in New York and loving everyday life in the city are poles apart. Thousands
                    of NYC visitors fall in love with the city each year (I was one), but only a handful can honestly
                    flourish as full-time residents. If you’ve been bitten by the New York love bug, know you’re not
                    alone, but getting caught up in the romance of the Big Apple will be miles away from dwelling in the
                    city permanently. If you can’t hack what I discuss below, you’re better off clearing your calendar
                    for a weekend or two each year, rather than uprooting your existence for what you fantasize as the
                    New York life. Here’s what you’ll need to be okay with to love living in NYC.</p>

                <blockquote>New York City is known for its fast-paced, around-the-clock lifestyle, which may be
                    overwhelming for newcomers. Known as "the city that never sleeps," this relentless metropolis draws
                    those seeking to advance their careers and push their limits.</blockquote>

                <p>NYC is culturally, religiously, and economically diverse. Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists – you
                    name the religion, and you’ll find followers in New York.
                    The city has long been an entry point for immigrants as well, so people from just about every nation
                    have settled here. If you’d rather mix with others like yourself and not be exposed to different
                    beliefs, cultures, and lifestyle choices, then NYC might not be your place.</p>

                <p>The city is much cleaner than it was 30 or 40 years ago, but you’ll still see trash on the streets
                    and in the subways. Even the “new” New York is far from pristine or sterilized, so to love living in
                    NYC, you have to be able to look and smell past the dirt, garbage, and urine, and appreciate the
                    atypical beauty of this town.</p>
